{"name":"Cetus #5","description":"Cetus have a tough, resilient skin, typically a muted grey, textured with scale like structures that resemble teeth. Their bodies are characterised by a powerful, uneven tail, often curved upwards, and distinctively pointed fins. A Cetus snout is particularly sharp, jutting forward to overshadow a crescent-shaped mouth with razor-sharp, triangular teeth, adding to their formidable, fantastical appearance. Living mostly in the coastal regions close to Skylab city makes them a common encounter.
