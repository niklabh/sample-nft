{"name":"Saurian #6","description":"Saurian are small reptiloid creatures that live in the vast areas of the outskirts of Skylab City. Equipped with long claws and fast runners, they appear dangerous, but their small size makes them less dangerous than other creatures in the wilds of the Outskirts. Due to their intelligent nature, they adapted and began to prey on the livestock of the surrounding farmers, in return making them an easy target and open to hunting.
